Scope of Project
Alarm Clock application with Social Interaction Element
Generally targeted towards people who have trouble waking up with conventional alarm clocks.


Brief Description
We intend to create a fun and interactive alarm clock application that will change the way how people start their day. This application will make people look forward to waking up in the morning by providing peer-to-peer activities for people to interact with and help each other wake up.
We investigated the current issues that people are commonly having as well as looking it from our perspectives and found that people generally have issues waking up in the morning. Many of them have the need to set multiple alarms in very short and unecessary intervals which is ineffective and also have the habit of snoozing their alarms frequently. These people do not get an adequate amount of sleep due to poor sleeping schedules and habits. We plan to tackle these issues to some extent with the help our of application.

Features:
    Wake people up on time with basic alarm clock functions
    Remind people to sleep on time with sleep scheduler and reminders

Planned Features:
    Interactive alarm dismissal activities (puzzles, etc.)
    Peer-to-Peer interactions
    Social element (further discussion required)

Workflow
[07 June 2016] Basic App functionality and GUI (feature 1)
[10 June 2016] Polishing and refining of app
[17 June 2016] Creation of additional feature to fulfil MVP (feature 2)
[20 June 2016] Polishing and refining of app + bug fixing
[25 June 2016] Research and Development done for Planned Features
[05 July 2016] Creation of networking framework (planned feature 1,2)
[15 July 2016] Creation of interactive framework (planned feature 1,2)
 

Motivation
We find ourselves having trouble waking up in the morning as we tend to oversleep even with alarms set or even sleeping through the alarm itself. We think that there could be a solution to this issue by re-thinking how the alarm clock could have functioned instead of simply having a snooze/dismiss function only.


User Stories
    As a normal user, I want to be able to wake up reliably on time.
    As a friend of the normal user, I want to have fun waking up my friends whilst ensuring they do wake up on time.
    As a community/group, I want to ensure everyone can wake up and be on time for scheduled meetings or activities.
